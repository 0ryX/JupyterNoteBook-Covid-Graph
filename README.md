Dynamic Covid-19 data mapping in Jupyter NoteBooks

  On 12/13/20 I created a Jupyter Notebook to map Covid-19 data for analysis. This is a personal 
project of mine and if you want to contribute or collaborate with me feel free to fork or hit me up. 
I am using John Hoptkins Github for Corona Virus case data but I also have other projects here on my
Github that I use to webscrape data from a couple different websites as well. Non of these is for profit,
but if you come across these and think they would be useful for data study please feel free to contact me 
and I can customize the scrapers or notebooks as to per you required needs. 

  Covid-19 has done a whole lot of damage to our world and our communites. Understanding patterns and 
shifts in spikes and the way it spreads can be very useful in the fight to regain a hold on this 
planet. Lets work together to help researcher and scientist build tools they need to analyze this 
information. Hopefully it can be useful...

  Notebook is a large file so I had to comment out all the fields, to run it you'll need some datascience libraries
and also uncomment the commands. The commands are also labeled and you can change dates and fields likes countries
regions and colors however you wish to view the data.
